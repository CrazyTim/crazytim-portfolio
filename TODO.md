### TODO:
- move location to under title, no need to be a button.
- only show the first couple of important tags, the remainder hidden by "plus 5 more..." label, so as not to overwhelm.
- explain how I helped solve actual business problems
- make item buttons larger same as ones in header? (only small difference, might as well)

##### Mario:
- Rosella too quiet compared to the others
- Modes?
- Stop all button
- When play star, stop music, but only if not Mario kart mode :(

##### Tap and Draw:
- More words
- Icon and app manifest
- storage-api tag?

##### Resume:
- add link to folio on resume
- git (source control)
